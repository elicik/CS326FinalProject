# Luke Gamelin
I've got experience in Java, Python, C#, C, HTML/CSS, and a bit of JS.
Before this course I pretty much haven't had any web dev experience beyond isolated uses of HTML/CSS, and no database experience.
I'm interested in vision/graphics and machine learning/AI projects, which would take some creativity to fit in with web development, but could work.
