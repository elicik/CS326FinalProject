## Overview
We are creating a viewer for Super Smash Bros. Melee [brackets](http://www.smash.gg) that integrate [Slippi](http://www.slippi.gg) recordings that are viewable within the browser by clicking on a specific match. Users include all players within these brackets, as well as casual observers who are interested in watching our tournaments. It will provide an in-browser view of match recordings that would otherwise require external programs to open, within an accessible context allowing playback for those with weaker computers, or on Chromebooks and mobile devices.
